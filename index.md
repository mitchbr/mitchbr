## Mitchell Brown's Github Portfolio Page

This repository contains both school and personal portfolio projects written in a variety of languages. I am currently in the process of completing a Computer Science degree through Oregon State University, and also possess a Mechanical Engineering degree from OSU.

### Highlighted Projects
 - [Grocery List App](grocery_list_app.md)
    - A simple mobile application with the purpose of improving the grocery shopping experience. Contains a page for creating a checklist, as well as a page for saving your favorite recipes. Ingredients from recipes can be added to the checklist to quickly make dinner plans and create a shopping list
    - Utilizes Flutter with SQLite.

 - [Recipe API with AWS](recipe_api.md)
    - An API developed both to learn AWS skills, as well as to integrate with the Grocery List App in the future. This API provides the capabilities to upload, retrieve, update, and delete recipes. In addition, images associated with those recipes can be uploaded, downloaded, and deleted.
    - Utilizes AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, S3, Secrets Manager, and RDS. Lambda functions are written in Python 3.

 - [Digital Audio Loop Station](audio_looper.md)
    - A digital implementation of the audio looper device. Records and plays back an arbitrary number of loops, allowing the user to become a one-man band.
    - Utilizes C++ with the SFML library.

### Other Software projects

 - [Assembly Language: String Primitives](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/blob/master/Older%20Projects/Assembly%20Language/str_primitives.asm)
    - This project demonstrates the use of string primitives and macros in assembly language. It takes the input of 10 integers from the user, then prints those numbers along with the sum and mean values of all 10 integers.

 - [SQL Music Database](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Music%20Database%20SQL)
    - Used to create a basic website, I designed the database and wrote the SQL queries to execute the database implementation.

 - [Nurikabe Game](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Nurikabe%20Game)
    - An implementation of the Nurikabe board game using tkinter with Python.

 - [Weather Forecasting Website](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Weather%20Forecast%20Website)
    - Written for my web development class, I created a basic website which shows the forecast for snowfall as well as ocean swell in various locations in Oregon.

 - [Small Shell](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/smallsh)
    - A simple shell written in the C language.
 
 - [Digital Signal Processing](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Signal%20Processing%20GUI)
    - Basic digital signal processing using a PyQt5 GUI interface. Allows the user to edit the start and end time of a wav file, as well as the high and low values for filtered frequencies. The user can then save a file of the edited audio.

 - [Arduino Window Blinds Management](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/blob/master/Older%20Projects/Arduino%20Heat%20Management/Automated%20Window%20BlindsManagement%20System.pdf)
    - Utilizes Arduino connected to a solar sensor to determine when window blinds should be open or shut to keep a room as cool as possible.
  

### Non Software Projects
While I am proud to be a great software engineer, my engineering knwoledge has been utilitzed in areas beyond software as well. These projects include some completed throughout my time as a mechanical engineering student, as well as some I have completed in my free time

 - [Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project](me_capstone.md)
    - My senior design project, designing a plug for a carbon fiber shell for the Shell Ecomarathon Team at OSU

 - [Surfboard restoration](surfboard_restoration.md)
    - The composite skills I learned in my senior design project have carried over very well into restoring old surfboards.
