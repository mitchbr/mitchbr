## Mitchell Brown's Github Portfolio Page

Welcome to my projects portfolio! This is a collection of projects I have worked on recently, from backend Python APIs to frontend Flutter applications, and even into high performance C++ audio applications. I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering, in search of a backend or full stack software engineering position.

### Highlighted Projects
 - [Grocery List App](grocery_list_app.md)
    - A simple mobile application with the purpose of improving the grocery shopping experience. Contains a page for creating a checklist, as well as a page for saving your favorite recipes. Ingredients from recipes can be added to the checklist to quickly make dinner plans and create a shopping list
    - Utilizes Flutter with SQLite.

 - [Recipe API with AWS](recipe_api.md)
    - An API developed both to learn AWS skills, as well as to integrate with the Grocery List App in the future. This API provides the capabilities to upload, retrieve, update, and delete recipes. In addition, images associated with those recipes can be uploaded, downloaded, and deleted.
    - Utilizes AWS services including API Gateway, Lambda, S3, Secrets Manager, and RDS. Lambda functions are written in Python 3.

 - [Digital Audio Loop Station](audio_looper.md)
    - A digital implementation of the audio looper device. Records and plays back an arbitrary number of loops, allowing the user to become a one-man band.
    - Utilizes C++ with the SFML library.

### Other Software projects
 - [Miscellaneous Projects](miscellaneous_projects.md)
    - Older projects, primarily created in school on my journey to becoming a software engineer.

### Non Software Projects
While I am proud to be a great software engineer, my engineering knwoledge has been utilitzed in areas beyond software as well. These projects include some completed throughout my time as a mechanical engineering student, as well as some I have completed in my free time

 - [Mechanical Engineering Senior Design Project](me_capstone.md)
    - My senior design project, designing a plug for a carbon fiber shell for the Shell Ecomarathon Team at OSU

 - [Surfboard restoration](surfboard_restoration.md)
    - The composite skills I learned in my senior design project have carried over very well into restoring old surfboards.
