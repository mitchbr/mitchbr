# Files:
# 1. "nt" Command
This bash script is used to carry out two actions at once: Opening a new Mac Terminal tab, and running a command line input in this tab.

I utilize this command frequently when writing Python scripts in vim. An example of using the script:

nt "vim example.py"

In this example, when run, the opened tab will launch the "example" Python file in vim, and now one tab allows you to edit the script and the other tab to run the script without the need to exit and enter vim.
