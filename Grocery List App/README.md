# Grocery List

An app used for storing recipes and creating checklists for the grocery store

## Future Plans
 - Add ReorderableListView to make the checklist reorderable
 - Add amounts for each item, allowing the user to remember how much of something they want (ie 2 apples)
 - Allow the user to edit a recipe after it's been saved
 - Use a Recipe API to let the user explore fun recipes published by others
