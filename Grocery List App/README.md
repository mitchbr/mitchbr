# Grocery List

An app used for storing recipes and creating checklists for the grocery store

## Future Plans
 - Keep checklist items after marked; move them to the bottom and draw line through them
 - Make checklist items text fields on the listview screen, allowing the user to add/edit items without going to a new screen
 - Add an 'instructions' field to recipes to allow the user to write out how to complete the recipe
 - Add amounts for each item, allowing the user to remember how much of something they want (ie 2 apples)
 - Allow the user to edit a recipe after it's been saved
 - Use a Recipe API to let the user explore fun recipes published by others

 - Bug Fix: Hitting the 'X' on a recipe item deletes the last item in the list, rather than the desired item
