# Mitchell Brown on GitHub
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I have a few repositories with some fun projects I'm working on. I am a recently graduated Computer Science/Mechanical Engineer form Oregon State University.

I greatly enjoy everything software, but I've found my true passion to be Backend Engineering. Currently, I'm an intern at Canoo, working with the Backend team on many of their projects.
