# Grocery List App

This app's purpose is to provide a means for creating a convenient place to create a grocery checklist not only for individual items, but or recipes as well. This app includes a page for saving recipes which can be added to the grocery checklist, a great way to quickly come up with ideas for cooking dinner. 

### The Checklist

The main page of the app is a simple checklist used for grocery shopping. It allows users to add items and check them off as they are placed in the cart. The GIF below shows the main functionality of the checklist, adding an item and chaking it off. Individual items can be added, as well as full recipes, shown in the next section.

### The Recipes Page

The recipes page is used for storing favorite recipes in a central location, where they can easily be added to the checklist. First, you can see the functionality for creating a recipe; the user names the recipe then adds items used in the recipe. Once the recipe has been saved, it can be previewed on the recipes page. In this preview, the used can check and uncheck items in the recipe. When the user clicks 'save,' all checked items will be sent to the main checklist to be picked up at the store.

### Future plans
Currently, I'm finishing up my recipe API, as well as making a PoC mobile app which utilizes its endpoints. The plan with this is to begin integrating the API endpoints into the grocery list app. I'm hoping to have a method to upload recipes, follow other users, and share recipes with each other. I have been creating a design which can be viewed on [Moqups](https://app.moqups.com/MltxY1FjFnH79G6LCsYqQ0UeCczZlPha/view/page/ad64222d5)
