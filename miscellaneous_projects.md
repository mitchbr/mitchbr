### Miscellaneous Projects
Primarily school projects, these are an array of projects I have worked on to aid in my progression towards becoming a software engineer. They are certainly not as flashy as projects I have worked on more recently, but it's always great to look back at where you came from!

### Projects
 - [Assembly Language: String Primitives](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/blob/master/Older%20Projects/Assembly%20Language/str_primitives.asm)
    - This project demonstrates the use of string primitives and macros in assembly language. It takes the input of 10 integers from the user, then prints those numbers along with the sum and mean values of all 10 integers.

 - [Nurikabe Game](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Nurikabe%20Game)
    - An implementation of the Nurikabe board game using tkinter with Python.

 - [Small Shell](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/smallsh)
    - A simple shell written in the C language.
 
 - [Digital Signal Processing](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/tree/master/Older%20Projects/Signal%20Processing%20GUI)
    - Basic digital signal processing using a PyQt5 GUI interface. Allows the user to edit the start and end time of a wav file, as well as the high and low values for filtered frequencies. The user can then save a file of the edited audio.

 - [Arduino Window Blinds Management](https://github.com/mitchbr/mitchbr/blob/master/Older%20Projects/Arduino%20Heat%20Management/Automated%20Window%20BlindsManagement%20System.pdf)
    - Utilizes Arduino connected to a solar sensor to determine when window blinds should be open or shut to keep a room as cool as possible.
